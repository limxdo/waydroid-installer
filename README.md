# waydroid-installer

This project provides an interactive installer script for installing, configuring, and removing Waydroid on both Debian-based and Arch-based Linux distributions.

The installer simplifies setting up:

- [Waydroid](https://github.com/waydroid/waydroid) (main package)

- [Waydroid Script](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script) (by casualsnek)

- Waydroid X11 launcher using Weston

Support is currently available for:

**Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)**

**Arch-based systems (Arch, Manjaro, etc.)**

> Support for Fedora/RHEL-based distributions is planned in the future.

## Usage:
---
### Arch / Arch-based

```bash
git clone https://github.com/limxdo/waydroid-installer.git
cd waydroid-installer/arch-based
./main.sh
```

### Debian / Debian-based

```bash
git clone https://github.com/limxdo/waydroid-installer.git
cd waydroid-installer/debian-based
./main.sh
```

## Requuirements

Before starting the installation, the script will automatically check for essential packages required to continue.

Make sure these packages are already installed to avoid issues:

### Debian-based:
- `python3`

- `python3-venv`

- `git`

- `curl`

- `ca-certificates`

If any of these packages are missing, the script will print a warning.

You can install them manually with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv git curl ca-certificates
```

### Arch-based:

- `base-devel`

- `yay`

To install them manually:

**Arch-based**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```

**Manjaro**

```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel yay
```

This check ensures everything is ready before the script starts installing Waydroid and its components.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

Before running the installer, make sure you're **inside the correct subdirectory** based on your distribution.

For example:

```bash
cd waydroid-installer/debian-based
./main.sh
```

**Running the script from outside its directory (like this üëá) may cause file path issues:**

```bash
./debian-based/main.sh  # ‚ùå Don't do this
```

**Always enter the subdirectory (`arch-based` or `debian-based`) first, then run `./main.sh.`**
